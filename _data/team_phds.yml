    I am a final-year PhD student supervised by Prof Pietro Liò. My research focuses on learning multimodal and graph-structured representations of the world; I am also interested in equipping embodied agents with visual reasoning, structural biases and navigation skills. From July to November 2020, I was a Research Scientist Intern at DeepMind, hosted by Piotr Mirowski in the Robotics, Embodied Agents and Lifelong learning (REAL) team led by Raia Hadsell. Previous research experience includes a Graph ML consultancy for Relation Therapeutics, an AI Residency at (Google) X and a research internship at Mila with Aaron Courville.

    I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working with Prof. Cecilia Mascolo and funded by Nokia Bell Labs. My research aims to investigate different approaches to efficiently and accurately provide uncertainty aware mobile sensing and apply them to system-level applications (i.e. sensor fusion, model and device selection). I am interested in exploring and ideating new ways towards scalable machine learning for edge and resource-constrained devices with a special focus on Bayesian deep learning techniques.

    My current research interests are centered around effective inductive biases for representation learning. More specifically, I research methods for graph representation learning and techniques for integrating heterogeneous data modalities in low data contexts. I also dabble in developing ML libraries to study methods.

    As of Michaelmas 2020, I am a second year PhD student interning at Facebook AI Research. In my PhD, I have been working on improving generalisation in deep learning and reinforcement learning, more specifically 1) new models for out-of-domain generalisation in visual reasoning 2) learning to generalise in multi-agent communication games 3) extensions to Invariant Risk Minimisation and the interplay of causal discovery and out-of-distribution generalisation.
