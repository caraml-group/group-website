    Prof Mateja Jamnik is developing AI techniques for human-like computing - she models how people solve problems to enable machines to reason and learn in a similar way to humans. She applies AI and reasoning techniques to medical data to advance personalised cancer medicine, and to education to personalise tutoring systems. Mateja is passionate about bringing science closer to the public and engages frequently with the media and public science events. She has been advising the UK government on policy direction in relation to the impact of AI on society.

    I specialise in Machine Learning, with around three decades' experience split mostly between my current post and a stint of several years at University College London, where I was Director of the Advanced Masters Programme in Intelligent Systems. I have published in multiple areas of theoretical and applied machine learning covering ground from computational learning theory---for example, deriving bounds on the sample complexity of the cross-validation estimate---to applications in organelle proteomics, particularly data fusion for protein localization. My current research focuses on machine learning for automated theorem-proving. This field provides multiple challenges, not least that the sensitivity of most solvers to small changes in the complexity of a heuristic forces a dichotomy between fast, simple methods that maintain and possibly improve the inherent performance of the solver, versus more complex "deep" methods that, while they might make better decisions, often take much longer to do so, and as a result can reduce ultimate performance.
